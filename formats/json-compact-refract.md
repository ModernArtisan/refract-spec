# JSON Compact Refract

JSON Compact Refract is a serialization format Refract for the purpose of
removing a lot of the object keys that are repeated throughout the full
serialization of Refract, as seen in the Refract specification. It also allows
for expressing structures in a tuple, which resembles other formats like XML or
Lisp.

## Data Structures

### Compact Element (array)

The Compact Element is a tuple where each item has a specific meaning. The
first item is the element name, the second is the meta attribute section, the
third is the attribute section, and the fourth is the content section.

The downside of this format is that there is no way to distinguish between a
normal array and a Compact Element. Because of this, in situations where there
is ambiguity, the array SHOULD be treated as a normal array and handled
accordingly. Ambiguity arises when an array is found in areas such as
`attributes` or `content` and requires out-of-band information how to handle
the array.

#### Members

- (string, required) - Name of the element
- (object, required) - Meta attributes of the element instance.
  - `id` - Unique Identifier, MUST be unique throughout the document
  - `ref` (Element Pointer) - Pointer to referenced element or type
  - `classes` (array[string]) - Array of classifications for given element
  - `title` (string) - Human-readable title of element
  - `description` (string) - Human-readable description of element
  - `links` (array[Link Element]) - Meta links for a given element
- (object, required) - Attributes of the element instance
- (enum, required) - Element content with any of the following types
  - (null)
  - (string)
  - (number)
  - (boolean)
  - (array)
  - (object)
  - (Compact Element)
  - (array[Compact Element])

## Example

In the base specification, serialization looks something like this for JSON:

```json
{
  "element": "foo",
  "content": "bar"
}
```

In Compact Refract, this same example looks like this:

```json
["foo", {}, {}, "bar"]
```

In this example, meta attributes and attributes are both required, even if the
objects are empty. This is because this format relies on the structure of the
array in order to determine values.

## Pros and Cons

The benefits as mentioned are that this is a more concise format. In some
cases, it may even be easier to write, or convert from other formats such as
XML or Lisp.

One downside of this format is that there is no simple way to distinguish a
normal array from a Compact Refract array. This makes it hard to embed Refract
within normal data structures, requiring that either the entire structure be
converted to Compact Refract, or that the user relies on domain-specific
information.
